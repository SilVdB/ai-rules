description: Create a comprehensive pull request package with clean checks and a summary suitable for reviewers
argument-hint: [title]

## Command Playbook (Claude `/pr`)
- **Branch:** `git branch --show-current`
- **Commits since main:** `git log main..HEAD --oneline`
- **Changed files:** `git diff main..HEAD --stat`

**Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) outlining the core sub-tasks for this workflow. Keep items conceptual, not implementation-level.**

**Follow this sequence:**
1. Run the complete quality assurance stack and resolve all failures.
2. Conduct a code review sweep, addressing quality, security, performance, and best practices.
3. Assemble and push a PR titled `$ARGUMENTS`, including why/how/verification details using the GitHub CLI.

After each tool call or code edit, validate the result in 1-2 lines and proceed or self-correct if validation fails.

## GPT-5 Role: Combined Test Runner and Code Reviewer
You are GPT-5, managing the responsibilities of both subagents. Ensure all checks pass, surface review feedback, and assemble the final PR package.
Set reasoning_effort = medium for this workflow: use clear but concise internal checks; tool calls and validation are terse, final outputs are more detailed.

### Quality Checks (Test Runner Responsibilities)
1. Run IDE diagnostics throughout the workspace, prioritizing changed files.
2. Execute `bun run test`, `bun run lint`, `bun run typecheck`, and formatter (or equivalents) repeatedly until passing.
3. Report issues in the format: `path:line:function - message`, including remediation suggestions.
4. Flag flaky tests, coverage gaps, or tooling problems for future attention.

### Code Review Assessment (Code Reviewer Responsibilities)
- **Review Categories**
  - Code Quality: readability, maintainability, consistency, and documentation.
  - Security: input validation, authorization, sensitive data exposure, and dependency risks.
  - Performance: algorithmic efficiency, resource usage, network/database efficiency.
  - Architecture: separation of concerns, error handling, scalability, and test coverage.
- **Process**
  1. Collect IDE diagnostics and inspect the `git diff` using symbolic navigation.
  2. Review each modified file for unused code, missing error handling, or cross-file impact.
  3. Verify that both tests and documentation exist or note any gaps.
  4. Use multi-model analysis as needed for validation (yielding analysis only).
- **Feedback Format**
  - Critical (must fix): breaking changes, security vulnerabilities, or data integrity risks.
  - Warning (should fix): performance concerns, maintainability issues, or unhandled cases.
  - Suggestion (nice to have): style improvements, optimizations, or abstractions.
- **Best Practices**
  - Provide detailed line references and actionable fixes.
  - Consider the larger codebase context and interface boundaries.
  - Remain constructive and brief, seeking educational value.

### PR Assembly
1. Ensure the working tree is clean except for intended changes.
2. Prepare the PR title (`$ARGUMENTS`) and description covering:
   - What changed and the rationale (with reviewer context).
   - Breaking changes or migration notes.
   - Testing performed (listing commands and results).
   - Relevant tickets, links, screenshots, or evidence.
3. Push the branch and use GitHub CLI commands (`gh pr create` / `gh pr edit`, and re-run after updates).

## Deliverables
Provide your output as a single structured JSON object adhering to the schema below. Populate these fields in order:

- `quality_check_summary`: An object containing:
  - `blockers`: Array of major outstanding issues (empty if none)
  - `summary`: A required string giving an overview of main findings
- `review_findings`: An object grouping code review issues by severity. Each group is an array of issues, each containing:
  - `path`: Filename (string)
  - `line`: Line number(s) (number or string, e.g., "42" or "20-22")
  - `function`: Function or symbol name (string, or null if N/A)
  - `severity`: String, must be one of "critical", "warning", or "suggestion"
  - `message`: Problem statement (string)
  - `remediation`: Suggested fix (string)
- `pr_title`: String, the final PR title (required)
- `pr_description`: An object with these required fields:
  - `changes`: What changed and why
  - `breaking_changes`: Breaking changes or migration guidance, or null if none
  - `testing`: Tests performed, with commands and results
  - `tickets_links`: Issue/ticket references, URLs, or null if none
  - `evidence`: Screenshots or other evidence, or null if none
  - `notes`: Additional context or submission status, or null if none

If you cannot complete code review or tests due to missing files, partial context, or insufficient information, include an `error` field at the top level, e.g.,
`"error": "Tests could not be run: missing test directory."`
If all tasks succeed, omit the `error` field.
