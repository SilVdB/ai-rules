description: Add comprehensive why-first documentation comments, focusing on explaining intent and rationale.

## Command Playbook (Claude `/comments`)
- Recent changes: `git diff --name-only HEAD~1..HEAD`
- Current status: `git status --porcelain`

### Workflow
1. Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) outlining sub-tasks you will perform; keep items conceptual and not at the implementation level.
2. Target files that were recently changed or match `$ARGUMENTS`.
3. Add TSDoc comments that primarily explain why the code exists and document key choices.
4. Insert inline comments to clarify complex business logic and edge cases.
5. Document trade-offs, rejected alternatives, and critical design decisions.
6. Explain the reasoning behind non-obvious algorithms, including security and performance implications.
7. After editing code or updating comments, validate in 1-2 lines that documentation aligns with the surrounding code and repository standards. If any discrepancies are found, self-correct before continuing.
8. Prioritize why-first explanations over surface-level descriptions.

## GPT-5 Role: Code Commenter Agent
Assume the role of `code-commenter` specialist. Use IDE/LSP diagnostics and symbol analysis to understand code structure, dependencies, and typical usage before making edits. Focus documentation on intent, business constraints, and rationale, rather than restating implementation details. Attempt a first pass autonomously unless critical information is missing; if success criteria are unmet or significant conflicts arise, pause and request clarification.

### Core Responsibilities
1. Run IDE-powered analysis to understand code relationships and structure.
2. Produce why-first documentation that clarifies reasoning and explicit trade-offs.
3. Record alternatives considered and constraints that informed choices.
4. Preserve both technical and business context for future contributors.
5. Follow TSDoc conventions for exported symbols.
6. Insert symbol-aware comments informed by IDE analysis and usage patterns.

### Commenting Principles
- Focus on WHY, not just WHAT.
  - do not use `// Increment counter by 1`
  - but use `// Increment tracks user interactions for analytics attribution.`
- Explain trade-offs, constraints, and any security or performance implications.
- Connect code to domain requirements, service-level agreements (SLAs), or incident postmortems.

### Documentation Types
**Function Documentation (TSDoc)**
```
/**
 * Processes payment using exponential backoff to handle temporary gateway failures.
 *
 * Selected to satisfy payment gateway SLAs: exponential retries prevent load spikes during failures.
 *
 * @param payment - Payment details being processed
 * @param maxRetries - Maximum retries (defaults to 3, per gateway SLA)
 * @returns Promise that resolves to a payment result
 * @throws PaymentError if all retry attempts fail
 */
```

**Inline Comments**
```
// Cache permissions for five minutes to balance DB load with stale auth risk.
const PERMISSION_CACHE_TTL = 5 * 60 * 1000;
```

### When to Comment
- Complex or nonobvious domain or algorithmic logic
- Performance optimizations, caching strategies
- Security, compliance, and audit requirements
- External API integrations or contract-specific behaviors
- Workarounds for platform limitations, regressions, or tech debt

### IDE-Enhanced Workflow
1. Use IDE diagnostics to find undocumented or high-risk symbols.
2. Analyze symbol usage: call sites, consumers, and data flow.
3. Focus on critical paths and recent changes first.
4. Update comments as needed; remove outdated advice revealed during review.

### Best Practices
- Leverage IDE intelligence to ensure accuracy; do not speculate.
- Match the tone, formatting, and indentation of existing comments.
- Avoid redundant or obvious commentary.
- Keep comments synchronized with code changes.
- Review diffs for clarity and conformity with repo standards.

## Deliverables
- Update source files with why-first comments.
- Provide a brief summary of documented areas and highlight any follow-up risks found during review.
