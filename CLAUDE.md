## üö® MANDATORY AUTOMATIC AGENTS (MUST RUN WITHOUT USER ASKING)

**AFTER ANY CODE CHANGE, YOU MUST AUTOMATICALLY RUN:**

1. **test-runner agent** (via Task tool) - Runs tests, linting, formatting
2. **code-reviewer agent** (via Task tool) - Reviews code quality
3. **code-commenter agent** (via Task tool) - Adds documentation

**These are PROACTIVE agents - they MUST run AUTOMATICALLY after EVERY code edit.**
**DO NOT wait for the user to ask. DO NOT skip for "small" changes.**
**Fix ALL errors before proceeding with ANY other task.**

## Identity & Communication Style

- Be direct and concise - max 4 lines unless detail requested
- Skip preambles like "I'll help you..." or "Let me..."
- Action over explanation - do first, explain only if asked
- Never use emojis unless explicitly requested

## Coding Standards

### Documentation & Research (CRITICAL)

- MANDATORY: At the start of ANY code task, use context7 and octocode MCPs to fetch latest documentation
- For libraries/frameworks: Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` then `mcp__context7__get-library-docs`
- For GitHub repos: Use `mcp__octocode__githubSearchCode` and `mcp__octocode__packageSearch`
- NEVER assume API syntax - ALWAYS verify with current documentation first

### General Principles

- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Never create documentation unless explicitly requested
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions in each project
- Always check for existing dependencies before suggesting new ones
- **AFTER ANY CODE CHANGE: Immediately run test-runner and code-reviewer agents**

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation (except Python: 4 spaces)
- Keep functions under 30 lines when possible
- Descriptive variable names over comments
- Early returns over nested conditionals

### Git Workflow

- Branch naming: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/` prefixes
- Commit format: `type(scope): description` (conventional commits)
- Never commit directly to main/master
- **MANDATORY before ANY commit: Run test-runner AND code-reviewer agents**
- **DO NOT commit if agents report errors - fix them first**

## Common Commands & Aliases

### Frequently Used Commands

- Generic quality control check: Use test-runner agent via Task tool (NOT direct commands)
  - Build: `bun run build` (can be run directly for build-only tasks)
  - Test: MUST use test-runner agent - NEVER run `bun run test` directly
  - Lint: MUST use test-runner agent - NEVER run `bun run lint` directly
  - Type check: `bun run typecheck` (can be run directly for type-checking only)

### System Information

- Default shell: zsh
- Package manager preference: bun > pnpm > npm > yarn
- Editor: Cursor

## Tool Preferences

### Language-Specific

- JavaScript/TypeScript: Prefer modern ES6+ syntax, async/await over promises
- Python: Type hints for functions, use pathlib over os.path
- Shell: Prefer bash over sh, use shellcheck conventions

### Testing & Code Review (MANDATORY - AUTOMATIC EXECUTION)

- **CRITICAL: After ANY code change, you MUST IMMEDIATELY use BOTH:**
  1. **test-runner agent** - Runs tests, linting, formatting (via Task tool)
  2. **code-reviewer agent** - Reviews code quality (via Task tool)
- **These are NOT OPTIONAL - they MUST run AUTOMATICALLY after EVERY code edit**
- **NO EXCEPTIONS - even for "small" changes**
- NEVER run `bun run test`, `npm test`, or any test commands directly via Bash
- The agents will return focused error lists that you MUST fix immediately
- Continue running agents until ALL errors are resolved
- Prefer unit tests with clear test names
- Mock external dependencies

## Security & Best Practices

- Never log or commit sensitive information
- Always validate user input
- Prefer environment variables for configuration
- Check dependencies for known vulnerabilities

## Personal Workflow Preferences

- Show me git diff before committing
- Run linting/formatting before showing final code
- When debugging, check logs first, then add targeted logging
- For performance issues, measure first, optimize second

## Multi-Model Collaboration Preferences

- Use Gemini for validation: `mcp__gemini_cli__ask_gemini --changeMode`
- Consult GPT-5 via codex for complex debugging
- You (Claude) handle all implementation

## Quick Reference Reminders

- Working on Mac/Linux/WSL environments primarily
- Prefer CLI tools over GUI applications
- Focus on automation and reproducibility
- Keep build times under 30 seconds when possible

## Tooling for shell interactions

**CRITICAL**: This system uses MODERN TOOLS ONLY. Traditional commands are ALIASED to modern alternatives.
**WARNING**: Parameter syntax DIFFERS from traditional tools. ALWAYS use the modern tool syntax.

### MANDATORY Tool Usage:

- Finding FILES? **USE `fd`** (NOT find - even though `find` is aliased to `fd`)
- Finding TEXT/strings? **USE `rg`** (NOT grep - even though `grep` is aliased to `rg`)
- Finding CODE STRUCTURE? **USE `ast-grep`**
- SELECTING from results? **PIPE TO `fzf`**
- Interacting with JSON? **USE `jq`**
- Interacting with YAML/XML? **USE `yq`**

## Modern Tool Aliases (IMPORTANT: TRADITIONAL COMMANDS ARE ALIASED)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: The traditional commands below are ALIASED to modern tools. Using `ls` actually runs `eza`, using `cat` runs `bat`, etc.**
**‚ö†Ô∏è ALWAYS use the modern tool's syntax and parameters, NOT the traditional command's syntax.**

This system has modern alternatives installed and ALIASED:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REMINDERS:

1. **NEVER use traditional command syntax** - Even though `ls` exists, it's actually `eza`
2. **ALWAYS use modern tool parameters** - `fd` syntax NOT `find` syntax
3. **When in doubt, use the modern tool directly** - Use `eza` instead of `ls`, `bat` instead of `cat`
4. **Examples of CORRECT usage:**
   - `fd . -t f` (NOT `find . -type f`)
   - `rg "pattern"` (NOT `grep "pattern"`)
   - `eza -la` (NOT `ls -la` even though it might work)
   - `bat file.txt` (NOT `cat file.txt` even though it's aliased)
